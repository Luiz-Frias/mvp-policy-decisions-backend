# Agent 01: Database Migration Specialist - Initial Status

## Status: STARTED
## Time: 2025-01-05 (Initial)

### Current Assessment

I have reviewed the existing migrations and found:
- ✅ Migration 001: Initial schema (customers, policies, claims)
- ✅ Migration 002: Users and quote system tables
- ✅ Migration 003: Rating engine tables
- ✅ Migration 004: Security and compliance tables

### Tasks Remaining

Based on my instructions, I need to create:

1. **Migration 005: Real-time Analytics Tables**
   - WebSocket connections tracking
   - Analytics events
   - Performance indexes

2. **Migration 006: Admin System Tables**
   - Admin users with enhanced permissions
   - Admin roles and permissions
   - System settings
   - Admin activity logs
   - Admin dashboards
   - Rate approvals workflow

### Observations

1. The existing migrations follow good patterns:
   - Proper foreign key constraints
   - Check constraints for business rules
   - Indexes for performance
   - Update triggers for audit trails
   - Partitioning for high-volume tables (audit_logs)

2. I notice that `users` table already exists (migration 002), so I'll need to ensure my admin tables work alongside it.

3. The audit_logs table in migration 004 is already partitioned, which is excellent for performance.

### Next Steps

1. Create migration 005 for real-time analytics tables
2. Create migration 006 for admin system tables
3. Ensure all tables follow the NO SILENT FALLBACKS principle
4. Add proper business rule documentation
5. Create comprehensive indexes

### Confidence: 100%

All requirements are clear and I have all necessary information to proceed.
