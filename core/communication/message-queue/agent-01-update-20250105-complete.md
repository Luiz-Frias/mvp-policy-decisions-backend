   - Validates index usage
   - Provides performance grading

### Key Design Decisions

1. **NO SILENT FALLBACKS Implementation**
   - All foreign keys have explicit ON DELETE behavior
   - All constraints have business rule documentation
   - Check constraints validate all business rules
   - No implicit defaults without justification

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Partial indexes for filtered queries (active connections, pending approvals)
   - GIN indexes on all JSONB columns
   - Composite indexes for common query patterns
   - Monthly partitioning for audit_logs table

3. **Security Features**
   - Row Level Security on admin tables
   - Encrypted fields for sensitive data
   - Comprehensive audit trail
   - Risk scoring for admin actions

4. **Business Rule Enforcement**
   - Quote status transitions validated
   - Admin deactivation requires reason
   - Notification delivery requires recipient
   - Rate approval workflow enforced
