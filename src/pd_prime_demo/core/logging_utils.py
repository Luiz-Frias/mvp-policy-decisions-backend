"""Central logging utilities for the MVP Policy Decision Backend.

This module enforces a consistent logging configuration across the entire
code-base and provides convenience helpers for retrieving module-scoped
loggers as well as monkey-patching the built-in ``print`` for legacy code
paths.

Key Features
------------
1. configure_logging(): idempotent initialization of the root logger.
2. get_logger(name): typed helper that always returns a configured logger.
3. patch_print(): optional helper that redirects ``print`` calls to the
   logging subsystem while preserving semantics.

Note: ``patch_print`` should only be used as a temporary bridge when a full
refactor is not yet feasible. Prefer explicit ``logger.<level>()`` calls in
new or updated code.
