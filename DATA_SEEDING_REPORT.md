- ✅ Territory factors applied properly
- ✅ Discounts and surcharges query successfully
- ✅ User authentication ready
- ✅ Demo scenarios accessible

## Demo Credentials

| Role | Email | Password | Purpose |
|------|-------|----------|---------|
| Admin | admin@mvppolicy.com | Admin123!@# | Full system access |
| Underwriter | john.underwriter@mvppolicy.com | Underwriter123! | Quote approval |
| Agent | jane.agent@mvppolicy.com | Agent123! | Quote creation |
| Demo | demo.agent@mvppolicy.com | Demo123! | Limited demo access |

## Scripts Created

1. **seed_data.py** - Seeds customers, policies, and claims
2. **seed_rate_tables.py** - Seeds rating engine data (updated for 6 states)
3. **seed_system_data.py** - Seeds users and demo scenarios
4. **test_seeded_data.py** - Validates all seeded data

## Usage

To re-seed the database:
```bash
# Clear and re-seed customer data
doppler run -- uv run python scripts/seed_data.py 100

# Clear and re-seed rate tables
doppler run -- uv run python scripts/seed_rate_tables.py

# Seed system users and demo scenarios
doppler run -- uv run python scripts/seed_system_data.py

# Test all seeded data
doppler run -- uv run python scripts/test_seeded_data.py
```

## Notes

- All passwords are hashed using bcrypt
- Demo data includes realistic scenarios for testing
- Rate tables comply with state regulations
- Foreign key relationships maintained
- Data supports full demo workflow from quote to policy

## Next Steps

The system is now ready for:
1. Quote generation testing
2. Rating engine validation
3. User authentication flows
4. Demo presentations
5. Performance testing with realistic data
