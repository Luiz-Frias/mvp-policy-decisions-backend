# PolicyCore Commercial License

## Why Commercial Licensing?

PolicyCore is available under AGPL-3.0 for open source use, which requires:

- All derivative works to be open source
- All network services using the code to provide source access
- Full compliance with copyleft requirements

If your use case doesn't align with AGPL-3.0 requirements, you need a commercial license.
