# Agent 05 Quote Service Developer - Status Update

## Timestamp: 2025-07-05 09:00:00 UTC

### Current Status
- Starting work on quote service implementation
- Detected that Agent 04 (Quote Model Builder) has not yet created quote models
- Will create quote models first to unblock service implementation

### Next Steps
1. Create comprehensive quote models (covering for Agent 04)
2. Implement quote service with full business logic
3. Create wizard state management
4. Build quote API endpoints

### Blockers
- None currently, proceeding with model creation

### Files to Create
- `src/pd_prime_demo/models/quote.py` - Quote domain models
- `src/pd_prime_demo/services/quote_service.py` - Quote business logic
- `src/pd_prime_demo/services/quote_wizard.py` - Wizard state management
- `src/pd_prime_demo/api/v1/quotes.py` - REST endpoints
- `src/pd_prime_demo/api/v1/admin/quotes.py` - Admin endpoints

### Dependencies
- Will coordinate with Agent 06 for rating engine integration
- Will prepare hooks for Agent 08 WebSocket support
