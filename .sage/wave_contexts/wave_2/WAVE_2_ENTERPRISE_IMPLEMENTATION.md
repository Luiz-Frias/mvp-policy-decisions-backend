# Wave 2 Enterprise Implementation - Full Production System

## Mission Statement

Wave 2 will deliver a **FULL PRODUCTION-GRADE P&C Insurance Platform** that demonstrates SAGE's ability to build enterprise systems in record time. This is NOT a simple demo - it's a complete system with all features implemented, showcasing how AI-assisted development can create sophisticated software rapidly.

## Core Principle: Production System AS the Demo

**The demo IS the production system.** We're building a rocketship, not a paper airplane. Every feature works, every calculation is real, every security measure is enforced. The only "demo" aspect is the mock data we seed it with.

## Complete Feature Implementation (MANDATORY)

### 1. **Comprehensive Quote Generation System**

#### Multi-Step Quote Wizard

- **Step 1**: Customer information with address validation
- **Step 2**: Vehicle/Property details with VIN decoder
- **Step 3**: Coverage selection with dynamic recommendations
- **Step 4**: Driver information with violation lookup
- **Step 5**: Review and premium calculation

#### Dynamic Rating Engine

```python
# Full rating calculation with all factors
class RatingEngine:
    def calculate_premium(self, quote_data: QuoteData) -> PremiumCalculation:
        base_premium = self._get_base_premium(quote_data.product_type)

        # Apply all rating factors
        territory_factor = self._get_territory_factor(quote_data.state, quote_data.zip)
        vehicle_factor = self._get_vehicle_factor(quote_data.vehicle)
        driver_factors = self._calculate_driver_factors(quote_data.drivers)
        coverage_factor = self._get_coverage_factor(quote_data.coverage_level)

        # AI risk assessment
        ai_risk_score = self._get_ai_risk_score(quote_data)

        # Calculate final premium
        premium = base_premium * territory_factor * vehicle_factor * driver_factors * coverage_factor * ai_risk_score

        return PremiumCalculation(
            base_premium=base_premium,
            factors={
                'territory': territory_factor,
                'vehicle': vehicle_factor,
                'drivers': driver_factors,
                'coverage': coverage_factor,
                'ai_risk': ai_risk_score
            },
            total_premium=premium,
            monthly_premium=premium / 12,
            calculation_timestamp=datetime.utcnow()
        )
```

#### State-Specific Rules Engine

- California: Proposition 103 compliance, good driver discounts
- New York: Prior approval requirements, assigned risk pools
- Texas: Credit scoring allowed, weather-related factors
- Florida: Hurricane deductibles, flood exclusions
- Illinois: Urban/rural differentials, anti-rebating laws

### 2. **Real-Time Features (WebSocket Implementation)**

#### Live Analytics Dashboard

```typescript
// Real-time metrics updating every 2 seconds
interface DashboardMetrics {
  quotesInProgress: number;
  quotesCompleted: number;
  conversionRate: number;
  averagePremium: number;
  recentActivity: ActivityItem[];
  aiAccuracy: number;
}

// WebSocket connection for live updates
const ws = new WebSocket(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL);
ws.on("metrics:update", (metrics: DashboardMetrics) => {
  updateDashboard(metrics);
});
```

#### Real-Time Quote Updates

- Live premium recalculation as users modify options
- Instant validation feedback
- Collaborative quote editing (multiple agents on same quote)
- Push notifications for quote status changes

### 3. **Complete Policy Management System**

#### Policy Lifecycle

- Quote-to-policy binding with document generation
- Policy endorsements (add/remove vehicles, change coverage)
- Mid-term cancellations with pro-rata calculations
- Renewal quotes 60 days before expiration
- Non-renewal workflows with reason codes

#### Document Generation

- Policy documents in PDF format
- ID cards for auto policies
- Declarations pages with all coverages
- State-specific forms and disclosures
- Electronic delivery with audit trail

### 4. **Advanced Rate Management System**

#### Visual Rate Editor

- Drag-and-drop rate table builder
- Real-time impact analysis
- A/B testing capabilities
- Version control with Git integration
- Approval workflows with role-based access

#### Rate Versioning & Deployment

```python
class RateTableVersion:
    version: str
    effective_date: datetime
    expiration_date: Optional[datetime]
    state: str
    product_type: str
    factors: Dict[str, RateFactor]
    approvals: List[Approval]
    deployment_status: DeploymentStatus

    def deploy(self) -> Result[DeploymentResult, Error]:
        # Validate all approvals received
        # Run rate validation tests
        # Deploy to production with rollback capability
        # Update cache layers
        # Notify affected systems
```

### 5. **AI-Powered Features (Without Document Processing)**

#### Risk Assessment Engine

```python
class AIRiskAssessment:
    def assess_risk(self, quote_data: QuoteData) -> RiskScore:
        features = self._extract_features(quote_data)

        # ML model predictions
        claim_probability = self.claim_model.predict(features)
        severity_estimate = self.severity_model.predict(features)
        fraud_risk = self.fraud_model.predict(features)

        # Combine into risk score with explanations
        risk_score = self._calculate_composite_score(
            claim_probability,
            severity_estimate,
            fraud_risk
        )

        return RiskScore(
            score=risk_score,
            adjustment_factor=self._score_to_factor(risk_score),
            explanations=self._generate_explanations(features, risk_score),
            confidence=self._calculate_confidence(features)
        )
```

#### Smart Recommendations

- Coverage recommendations based on customer profile
- Discount eligibility detection
- Cross-sell opportunities (auto + home bundles)
- Retention risk predictions

### 6. **Enterprise Security & Compliance**

#### Authentication & Authorization

```python
# JWT with role-based permissions
class SecurityMiddleware:
    ROLE_PERMISSIONS = {
        'agent': ['quote:create', 'quote:read', 'policy:read'],
        'underwriter': ['quote:all', 'policy:all', 'rate:read'],
        'admin': ['*:*']
    }

    async def authorize(self, user: User, resource: str, action: str) -> bool:
        required_permission = f"{resource}:{action}"
        user_permissions = self.ROLE_PERMISSIONS.get(user.role, [])

        # Check specific permission or wildcard
        return (required_permission in user_permissions or
                f"{resource}:all" in user_permissions or
                "*:*" in user_permissions)
```

#### Comprehensive Audit System

- Every action logged with user, timestamp, IP
- Immutable audit trail with blockchain-style hashing
- PII access tracking for compliance
- Change history for all entities
- Compliance reporting dashboards

#### Data Security

- Field-level encryption for PII (SSN, DL#)
- Tokenization for display purposes
- Secure key management with rotation
- Data retention policies with automatic purging
- GDPR-compliant data export/deletion

### 7. **Performance & Scalability**

#### Caching Strategy

```python
# Multi-level caching with Redis
class CacheManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.l1_cache = {}  # In-memory for hot data
        self.l2_cache = Redis()  # Distributed cache
        self.cache_aside_db = PostgreSQL()  # Persistent store

    async def get_with_fallback(self, key: str) -> Optional[Any]:
        # L1 cache (nanoseconds)
        if value := self.l1_cache.get(key):
            return value

        # L2 cache (microseconds)
        if value := await self.l2_cache.get(key):
            self.l1_cache[key] = value
            return value

        # Database (milliseconds)
        if value := await self.cache_aside_db.get(key):
            await self.warm_caches(key, value)
            return value

        return None
```

#### Performance Optimization

- Database query optimization with explain plans
- Prepared statements for all queries
- Connection pooling with optimal sizing
- Async/await throughout the stack
- CDN for static assets
- Response compression
- HTTP/2 push for critical resources

### 8. **Monitoring & Observability**

#### Metrics Collection

```python
# Prometheus metrics for all operations
class MetricsCollector:
    quote_counter = Counter('quotes_created_total', 'Total quotes created')
    quote_histogram = Histogram('quote_generation_seconds', 'Quote generation time')
    active_users = Gauge('active_users', 'Currently active users')

    @quote_histogram.time()
    async def track_quote_generation(self, quote_data):
        result = await self.generate_quote(quote_data)
        self.quote_counter.inc()
        return result
```

#### Distributed Tracing
